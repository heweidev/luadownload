multi-task download with Lua using luaSocket

This project aims at create a multi-task download program using Lua coroutine.

Lua coroutine is not a real thread, so we don't need to syn between threads, 
and the frame work can be very simple.

In order to quickly implements the idea, I use luaSocket for help. And moidify few details.

Thanks.
